<h1>Networking</h1>
<p>Remote Method Invocation (RMI) is the networking protocol that is used in this application. Below are the different servers and clients that are created.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A main <strong>server</strong> is intially started, this will serve as the place that all of the active games will be stored</li>
  <li>When a user creates a new game in the lobby the main server will be notifyed and then proceed to create a new <strong>game server</strong> this will be the place that all clients in a given game will connect to</li>
  <li>Clients will enter through the <strong>lobby</strong> which after choosing to either create or join a game will pass off to the <strong>game client</strong> which will connect tpo the appropriate game</li>
</ul>
